# Relation Databases Notes

## Expectations

- quick introduction re Relational Databases
- cover **using** a database
- SQLite3 as the Database Management System and Engine
  - simpler to get started
  - no need for server
  - missing some features
  - not intended for large applications

## Using SQLite Studios

- `Add Database`
- Click the `folder` button
- Navigate to your directory and into the file that is named `.db3` or whatever correct path.
- take note about how we cannot open the db3 file on VSCode, but look into it using SQL! Awesome tables.
